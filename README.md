 ## Project Description: Student Performance Analysis

This project involves an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of student performance to identify the key factors influencing their academic scores. The dataset includes attributes such as:

- **Demographics**: Gender and Ethnic Group (Groups A to E)
- **Parental Information**: Parental Education Level and Marital Status
- **Study Habits**: Weekly Study Hours, Test Preparation, and Number of Siblings
- **Lifestyle**: Practice of Sports, Lunch Type, and Transportation Means
- **Academic Scores**: Math, Reading, and Writing Scores  

## **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to understand **why student scores are impacted** by analyzing relationships between academic performance and factors like study hours, parental education, and lifestyle habits.

## **Key Insights**  
1. Students who study for more than **10 hours per week** and whose parents have **higher education levels** tend to perform better across all subjects.  
2. The **Parentâ€™s Marital Status** has **minimal impact** on student scores.  
3. Practicing sports shows a **slight positive correlation** with academic performance.  
4. **Ethnic Group Distribution** analysis shows **Group C** has the most students (31.99%), followed by **Group D** (26.05%).

## **Visualizations**  
The analysis includes detailed visualizations to uncover trends and correlations, such as:  
- **Heatmaps** to highlight correlations between variables.  
- **Boxplots** to show score distributions for study habits and lifestyle factors.  
- **Pie Charts** to depict the distribution of Ethnic Groups.  
- **Bar and Count Plots** for categorical variable analysis.

## **Tools and Libraries**  
- **Python**: For data manipulation and visualization  
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

This project provides actionable insights into the factors affecting student performance, highlighting the importance of parental education and study habits in academic success.
